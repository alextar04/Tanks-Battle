# Tanks Battle
A brief overview of the game's functionality
The game consists of a cooperative game of two players on the network, controlling tanks against the enemy team's tanks that appear. The allied team wins if all the enemy tanks of the opposing team are destroyed. If the allies have no health left, the bots win, and the corresponding message is displayed. Next, let's take a closer look at the objects involved in the game and the interaction between them, including network interaction.

Use technology:

- To draw objects in the game menu and on the map, we use 3D models and 2D textures drawn in the Blender program, as well as those obtained in the Assets Store. We use the C# language and the UnityEngine library to control game logic, menu navigation, and inter-network interaction.
- To organize the game over the network, the Photon 2 library is used, which also has C# support.
- The cross-platform build uses the Unity compiler, as well as the git version control system to save the current versions of the project during development.
